	<h1>About Us</h1>
<p> BitsandGears is a resource for learning robotics (Intended for VEX students specfically, but concepts apply)
<br>The ultimate guide and resource list for learning competitive robotics, mechanical engineering, and programming concepts.
<br>When getting started with robotics I found it hard to find resources to build up my knowledge of mechanical  engineering, programming, and in general competitive robotics. To address this problem I'm going to be building up a knowledge library, for robotics, and getting started with competitve robotics as a whole. <br> The biggest problem that I face is learning concepts and gaining knowledge that I am able to apply to the VEX challenge</p>
<p>I would like to build a community, knowledgebase, and starting point for members of the competitve robotics community. <br> Please contribute to the site by adding a pull request to improve documentation, or to add a new article to the site. <br> You may do this through the github repo</p>
	<h1>Who is this project for?</h1>
	<p>This project is for those starting out with robotics who don't know how to start, or those who would like to build their mechanical know-how to imprvove their competitve robotics game.</p> 
	<p>This project is generally meant for the competitve robotics community (Especially the VEX IQ and VRC Divisions), I hope that everyone can learn something, and that we can all contribute to a project that betters everyone's robotics smarts<p>
