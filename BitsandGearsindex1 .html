						<h1>Welcome to BitsandGears!</h1>
						<p>BitsandGears is an open source platform for sharing robotics knowledge and concepts with a community of robotics students who want to learn more about programming, engineering, and just generally improve their robotics game</p>
						<p>BitsandGears is going to be used inform people of concepts that they are able to use to improve their robots and learn about them more in depth than they originally could have.</p>
					<p>BitsandGears approaches learning through a user driven apporach. We are simply a library to provide the content and resources for you to learn and apply to your robots, and to grow your knowledge of the STEM ecosystem</p>
					<p>BitsandGears does not provide direct instructions for how to do things, but there is no reason for you have to have to reinvent concepts for your robot either, so we provide the information for you to design and build your own mechanisms/programs(-You learn by doing)</p>
					<p>BitsandGears provides the information  that you need to develop your mechanical engineering skills and programming skills to the next level</p>
